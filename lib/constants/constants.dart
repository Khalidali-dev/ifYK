    "“As a 16-year-old in the suburbs of New York, my social options were limited. The crash of the NFT space, which I had dedicated most of my time to during tenth grade, highlighted my lack of real-life social opportunities.\n\nSince elementary school, I dreamed of creating an app. After realizing that neither I nor anyone I knew had a reliable way to find out what was happening nearby, I started ifYK.\n\nThe original concept was quite different from what we have today, as the events were all user-generated and focused on helping people discover and post their house parties (which I wanted to find out about myself).”\n\nAfter over a year of development I realized two major issues. Privacy Concerns: House parties are rarely made public, especially by people my age, as most don't want strangers showing up. Event Generation: Relying solely on user-generated events would make it difficult to populate the app with enough events to be useful.\n\nReflecting on these challenges, I returned to the fundamental question that inspired ifYK: “What’s going on near me?” I discovered that there wasn't a straightforward way to answer this. Events were scattered across numerous platforms, none optimized for event discovery.\n\nAfter two years of development hurdles, redesigns, and rebranding, we finally launched \"ifYK,\" a platform designed to effortlessly answer, “What’s going on near me?”";
